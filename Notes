bundle gem "Dark Souls 3 API"
MIT license - yes
code events/
should set up all the folders and files we normally see on Learn.


terminal set up

git init
  github.com
git status
git add .
git commit -m "first commit" this is a message as a status essentially
to send to github:
  git remote add origin https://github.com/etc. to put into the terminal.
git push -u origin master 
  normally just git push origin master, only need to do it once with -u
  
create a new file in bin
    "run" -- executable file
#!/usr/bin/env ruby in run file is a "Shabang line" it converts the whole expression to ruby.

I need to map out how I Want the app to work:

// welcome the user?
CLI Class -- deals with stuff showing on the terminal
API Class -- deals with API stuff
Something Dark Souls 3 Class -- to hold all objects and stuff

environment file
    holds all of my classes and all of my gems?
  
might not need version.rb file either

lib/DarkSouls/3classesfromabove
  


class CLI
  def start
    puts "hello"
    puts "please select a category:"
    input = gets.strip
    API.get_events(input)
    Event.all.each.with_index(1) do ||
  end
end

class Dark Souls
  @@all = []

  def initialize
    @@all << self
  end

  def self.all
    @@all
  end
end

in environment.rb
  require "./lib/darksouls/cli"
  require "./lib/darksouls/api"
  same with dark souls


run file in bin >>
  cd bin
  ls -lah
  if your things arent the same do: chmod +x run "folder name"


we want to connect the run file to our environment file

run file:
require './lib/environment' in the run file
CLI.new.start(this should welcome the user)

class API
  def self.get_events(zipcode) zipcode is user input
    
  end
